      THE BELOW DISCLOSURE AND AUTHORIZATION LANGUAGE IS FOR MANDATORY USE BY ALL ACCOUNT HOLDERS
    </p>

    <p class="secondParagraf">
      In connection with your application for employment with
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">JD FREIGHT</span>
      (“Prospective Employer”), Prospective Employer, its employees, agents or contractors may
      obtain one or more reports regarding your driving, and safety inspection history from the
      Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA).
    </p>
    <p class="secondParagraf">
      When the application for employment is submitted in person, if the Prospective Employer uses
      any information it obtains from FMCSA in a decision to not hire you or to make any other
      adverse employment decision regarding you, the Prospective Employer will provide you with a
      copy of the report upon which its decision was based and a written summary of your rights
      under the Fair Credit Reporting Act before taking any final adverse action. If any final
      adverse action is taken against you based upon your driving history or safety report, the
      Prospective Employer will notify you that the action has been taken and that the action was
      based in part or in whole on this report.
    </p>
    <p class="secondParagraf">
      When the application for employment is submitted by mail, telephone, computer, or other
      similar means, if the Prospective Employer uses any information it obtains from FMCSA in a
      decision to not hire you or to make any other adverse employment decision regarding you, the
      Prospective Employer must provide you within three business days of taking adverse action
      oral, written or electronic notification: that adverse action has been taken based in whole or
      in part on information obtained from FMCSA; the name, address, and the toll free telephone
      number of FMCSA; that the FMCSA did not make the decision to take the adverse action and is
      unable to provide you the specific reasons why the adverse action was taken; and that you may,
      upon providing proper identification, request a free copy of the report and may dispute with
      the FMCSA the accuracy or completeness of any information or report. If you request a copy of
      a driver record from the Prospective Employer who procured the report, then, within 3 business
      days of receiving your request, together with proper identification, the Prospective Employer
      must send or provide to you a copy of your report and a summary of your rights under the Fair
      Credit Reporting Act.
    </p>
    <p class="secondParagraf">
      Neither the Prospective Employer nor the FMCSA contractor supplying the crash and safety
      information has the capability to correct any safety data that appears to be incorrect. You
      may challenge the accuracy of the data by submitting a request to
      <a href="https://dataqs.fmcsa.dot.gov">https://dataqs.fmcsa.dot.gov</a>. If you challenge
      crash or inspection information reported by a State, FMCSA cannot change or correct this data.
      Your request will be forwarded by the Data Qs system to the appropriate State for
      adjudication.
    </p>
    <p class="secondParagraf">
      Any crash or inspection in which you were involved will display on your PSP report. Since the
      PSP report does not report, or assign, or imply fault, it will include all Commercial Motor
      Vehicle (CMV) crashes where you were a driver or co-driver and where those crashes were
      reported to FMCSA, regardless of fault. Similarly, all inspections, with or without
      violations, appear on the PSP report. State citations associated with Federal Motor Carrier
      Safety Regulations (FMCSR) violations that have been adjudicated by a court of law will also
      appear, and remain, on a PSP report.
      <br /><br />
      The Prospective Employer cannot obtain background reports from FMCSA without your
      authorization.
